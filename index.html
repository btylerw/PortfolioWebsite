                Hello! My name is Tyler Brown! I am a Marine Corps veteran who is currently studying Computer Science at CSU Bakersfield.
                My interest in coding first began when I learned the basics of Python for fun during my enlistment, but it really took off
                once I began my first semester at CSUB and really learned the power of programming. My main interests lie in web development
                with a passing interest in game development. When I'm not working on assignments or projects, you can usually catch me spending time
                with family or gaming with friends.
